Here are some observations about the provided quiz application:  

1. *Dynamic Functionality*:  
   - Questions, options, and results are dynamically rendered, which ensures scalability if more questions are added to the array.  

2. *Feedback on Answers*:  
   - The user gets immediate feedback on their selection (green for correct, red for incorrect), making it interactive and engaging.

3. *Score Calculation*:  
   - The score is accurately updated and displayed at the end of the quiz.

4. *Button Disabling*:  
   - Disabling options after a selection ensures the integrity of the user's response to each question.

5. *Responsive Navigation*:  
   - A "Next" button is displayed only after answering a question, guiding the user to move sequentially through the quiz.

6. *Basic Styling*:  
   - The styling is simple but effective. It can be improved to make the application more visually appealing.

7. *Scalability*:  
   - Adding more questions is straightforward; just append new objects to the questions array.

### Improvement Suggestions:
1. *Progress Tracker*:  
   - Add a progress bar or counter (e.g., "Question 2 of 5") to indicate how far the user is in the quiz.

2. *Shuffle Questions/Options*:  
   - Randomize the order of questions and options to make the quiz less predictable.

3. *Timer*:  
   - Introduce a timer for each question to make the quiz more challenging.

4. *Better UI/UX*:  
   - Use animations or more refined styles to enhance the user experience.

5. *Restart Option*:  
   - Add a "Restart Quiz" button at the end, allowing the user to retake the quiz without reloading the page.

6. *Accessibility*:  
   - Add aria-labels or improve keyboard navigation to ensure the quiz is accessible for users with disabilities.

7. *Mobile Optimization*:  
   - Ensure the design is fully responsive for smaller screens and touch interactions.
